## Features So Far

### A Scalable Configuration Module

The configuration module is a simple yet powerful module that allows you to load configuration values from various sources (e.g. environment variables, configuration files, etc.) and make them available throughout your application. Here in the repository, we use `@nestjs/config` with zod to build a robust configuration module.
